spectranet-tnfs-fuse
====================

Linux FUSE filesystem driver for use with the TNFS filesystem that the ZX Spectranet uses.
I made this only because I wanted easy access to vexed4.alioth.net from my computer, and
the corresponding directories in SVN were empty.

Quality is to be considered Alpha. If it eats your data, I take no responsibility.

I'm creating this repository here because I can't for the life of me figure out how to contact
Winston, the creator of the Spectranet Ethernet interface for the ZX Spectrum, to include this
into his repository.
